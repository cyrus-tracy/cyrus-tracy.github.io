        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        My name is Cyrus Tracy. I am a sophomore at the University of 
        North Carolina-Chapel Hill, go Tar Heels! I am originally from 
        Denver, Colorado. I am studying Biostatistics at the Gillings 
        School of Global Public Health. I am also pursuing a Major in 
        Mathematics and a Minor in Hispanic Studies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I am an active person who loves to be 
        outside, whether it be skiing, hiking, rafting, or even just 
        going for a run! Colorado has enabled me to do a lot of these 
        things, and I am always finding new ways to get outside in 
        North Carolina!      
      </p>

      <p>
        I am always looking for new experiences, both academically and 
        out in the world!
      </p>
